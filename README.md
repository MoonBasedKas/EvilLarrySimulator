# EvilLarrySimulator

This is a c++ port of a project I originally wrote in C that just did the audio sound at a set time. This one is meant to perform a few more actions and give the user more power
without requiring them to modify code. Instead everything that is done is detected via files.

REMEMBER TO USE THE -lwinmm flag
