# EvilLarrySimulator

This is a c++ port of a project I originally wrote in C that just did the audio sound at a set time. This one is meant to perform a few more actions and give the user more power
without requiring them to modify code. Instead everything that is done is detected via files. If you want to actually do this just write a mod for whatever game you're doing
rather than forcing system inputs.

REMEMBER TO USE THE -lwinmm flag
