# EvilLarrySimulator

This is a c++ rewrite/upgrade of a joke I did a while ago. Originally it was a c program that would play a audio file called audio.wav.
This version is meant to play that same audio file but also enter inputs on behalf of the user. This is meant for a challange run for a game.
This upgrade version is written in c++ to gain access to language features but to learn a bit more with c++.

Sadly this is windows only, maybe a linux port in due time however for now remember when compiling to include -lwinmm in g++.

## Features
- Audio playback
- Input

## Future Features
- Configuration files
- User selected commands
- Changable audio
- Multiple commands
